# Bayesian Deep Learning with EM-TDAMP

This project explores a hybrid Bayesian inference pipeline for high-dimensional sparse signal reconstruction using Expectation Maximization (EM) and Turbo DeepAMP (TDAMP).

Developed as part of an M.Tech Project, this work integrates variational Bayesian learning and deep denoising within an EM framework to enhance signal recovery in noisy environments. The system demonstrates improved convergence, robustness, and computational efficiency through the use of learned denoisers embedded in the iterative EM loop.

> **Note:** Due to ongoing work on related paper publications, the source code is not publicly shared at this time.
